GE VScan Example Exports
========================

This folder contains example exports taken from a VScan. This is how the usb file will look.

On an android device, it'll be the /mnt/<storage folder>/Archive/<serial>_<exam_id>_<date>

Where the date is YYYYMMDDTHHmmss

The android interaction should allow for the clinician to choose files they want to select.

Batch Uploads
=============

The project may require to do batch uploads off the scanner at the end of the day.

If batches are happening, then it's paramount to be able to capture all the metadata of the scan 
(serial, exam, etc) to then match with the xform submissions on the other side.
